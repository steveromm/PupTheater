# PupTheater

My personal project practicing flexbox and responsive design for my Codecademy Full-Stack Developer course.

## Features

- Display & Positioning Practice
- Flexbox Practice

## Uses

It can be easy to forget coding lessons without practice, so each section has a practice space for working with code learned in that lesson to see results.

## Technologies

Currently, this site utilizes HTML, CSS, Git and Github, but as I learn new languages and concepts they will be added as well. I'm looking at you, Javascript!

## Dog Puns
As a thank you to anyone who may have perused my wildy novice code, please enjoy the various dog puns that litter the page.
